## Overview

The task was to turn a wireframe to code, the wireframe was a preview for a product card.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I studied the image then i proceeded

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to work better with media queries

I learned how to work with Grid and that i could have containers that use display flex within my Grid

@media(max-width:345px){

}

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I would definitely require more practice with css grid and css in general.
